Merged Model of "Osmo-Sim", submitted by The Batchelors (Purdue ME 463 Senior Design), 4/30/21
Contact: Hayden Schennum, hschennum@gmail.com

Model Simulink file: Merged_Model.slx
Relevant model files:
wecSimInputFile.m
ptoSimInputFile.m
userDefinedFunctions.m

To run the model:
0. Get MATLAB.
1. Go to http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/index.html, follow instructions on obtaining WEC-Sim source code. GitHub link is:  https://github.com/WEC-Sim/wec-sim.  
	***MAKE SURE to add the WEC-Sim source code to your MATLAB working directory, as specified in instructions!
2. Go to http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/index.html, follow instructions on obtaining PTO-Sim source code. GitHub link is (you just need PTO-Sim): https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim_Applications
3. Place this folder "Osmo-SIM" within WEC-Sim_Applications>PTO-Sim>OSWEC
4. In MATLAB, make sure your working directory is "Osmo-SIM"
5. Type >>wecSim in command window

If successful, model should run and output relevant values.  Most recent output in Command Window should be "LCOW = 2.338"
